# Scraping Steam

__Want to collect some data such as prices, 
discounts, releases,etc from the list of games?__

Cool, this project will help you to take a list of games from [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/).
And the result will be saved as excel and json formats.

I rely on beautifulsoup4 and requests packages to complete this project.

_Don't forget to hit the star button for me, thanks._
